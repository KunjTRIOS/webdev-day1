    <p>Dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill, 
        only a few miles from her house. The car had been hastily packed and Marta was 
        inside trying to round up the last of the pets. Dave went through his mental list of the most
         important papers and documents that they couldn't leave behind. He scolded himself 
         for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered 
         everything that was needed. He continued to wait for Marta to appear with the pets, 
         but she still was nowhere to be seen.
